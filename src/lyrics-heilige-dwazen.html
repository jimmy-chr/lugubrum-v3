                my underwear | and the grass-stalks along my arduous path | sang that
                it was good | for they witnessed my fasting | surviving on spiritual beer
                | I became Christs ; a whole bunch of them | we flogged each other | in
                our ferocious dance | spinning like dogs behind our tails | and none of
                us changed his underwear |

                into my face | scorching my beard and eyeballs | merging time, space and
                matter | there was only the smell of Uranus | there I held the world in

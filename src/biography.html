                <strong>1992</strong> From the ashes of obscure bands like
                Panopticon and Acromegal, <strong>LUGUBRUM</strong> emerges,
                after its vision had appeared before
                <strong>Barditus</strong> during a delirium.
                <strong>Zwelg</strong> leaves the band after two songs are
                created and activities are derived to drinking in the woods.<br />
                <strong>1993</strong> Barditus teams up with
                <strong>Midgaard</strong>. The Lugubrum temple is built and
                severe worship follows, resulting in the
                <strong>&#8216;Black Prophecies&#8217; demo</strong>.<br />
                <strong>1994</strong> Release of the <strong>94 promo</strong>.
                This early material shows influences of Dark Throne, Burzum,
                Bathory,&#8230;<br />
                <strong>1995</strong> Release of the atmospheric first
                full-length album <strong>&#8216;Winterstones&#8217;</strong>,
                on the clandestine label <strong>Skramasax</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
                <strong>1997</strong> Release of
                <strong>&#8216;Gedachte &amp; Geheugen&#8217;</strong> , the
                first part consisting of fast and raw &#8216;war metal&#8217;,
                the second of dark synthesizer music.<br />
                <strong>1998</strong> Zwelg, who had been playing in FINSTERNIS
                with Svein, rejoins Lugubrum on bass.
                <strong>&#8216;De Zuivering&#8217;</strong>, recorded and mixed
                in one single night of alcohol and chaos and released as a split
                with Sudarium (B) on Skramasax and Lowlife records, carries by
                now typical Lugubrum riffing combined with thrash elements and
                introduces the term
                <strong>&#8216;Boersk Blek Metle&#8217;</strong>, which soon
                catches on as definition of their own perverted style.On October
                17th Lugubrum play their first and infamously drunk live concert
                during the <strong>Lugburz fest</strong> at
                <strong>St-Niklaas</strong>. For this occasion
                <strong>Svein</strong> also joins on drums. A second (sober)
                live show is given on December 26th at the
                <strong>Frontline</strong> in <strong>Ghent</strong>.<br />
                <strong>1999</strong> The legendary
                <strong>&#8216;De Totem&#8217;</strong> album is released on
                <strong>Berzerker Records</strong> (NL).<br />
                <strong>2000</strong> A third performance , august 18th at the
                <strong>Feel Estate art festival</strong> in the Backstage,
                <strong>Ghent</strong> : the band is locked up in a damp cellar
                for 8 hours with their instruments and fridge full of beer, the
                spectacle can be followed on screen elsewhere.&nbsp;<br />
                <strong>2001</strong> Barditus , having a rough time controling
                his alcohol abuse and disliking new Lugubrum material, quits the
                band after squealing on not more than 2 of 16 tracks on the next
                masterpiece <strong>&#8216;Bruyne Troon&#8217;</strong>,
                released on Skramasax. <strong>Midgaars</strong> takes over the
                vocals.&nbsp;<br />
                <strong>2002</strong> Barditus recovers and returns to Lugubrum,
                carrying a crate of beer and even a bunch of guitar riffs,
                resulting in <strong>&#8216;Al Ghemist&#8217;</strong>, a dark
                and sober opus, released on LP by
                <strong>Painiac records</strong> (B) and on cd by
                <strong>Full Moon Productions</strong> (US) as a split with
